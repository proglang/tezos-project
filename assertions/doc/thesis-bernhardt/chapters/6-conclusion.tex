\chapter{Conclusion and outlook}\label{chap:conclusion}
In order to make use of off-chain computations in smart contracts, this thesis proposed an approach that engages the validators of the blockchain network in a distributed effort to check assertions over input parameters. It covered the partially generic off-chain component of the design and implementation of this approach, while also providing some projections and considerations for the Tezos specific protocol design.

As a first step, it identified properties that can be checked with the proposed scheme, represented by a set of formulas in propositional logic using quantification. By means of some practical use-cases, the semantic differences between universal and existential quantification in relation to assertion checking were highlighted, namely that existential quantification requires the validators to find proofs instead of counterexamples. Even though the thesis focused on distributed refutation, distributed verification is a meaningful extension of future work on this topic.

Based on the set of formulas, the generic off-chain design introduced a simple syntax to express assertions for one or more entrypoints of a contract, followed by a formalization of their transformation which comprises the negation of the formula and translation of quantifiers to efficient random generators. After exploring several orchestration strategies of contract and assertion code, the Tezos specific off-chain design proposed to originate the assertion and manager code modularly and discussed the necessary implementations within the off-chain infrastructure and, partially, the protocol design. This off-chain infrastructure was implemented in OCaml in form of a toolchain, which translates a file of assertions to executable smart contracts for the target platform.\\

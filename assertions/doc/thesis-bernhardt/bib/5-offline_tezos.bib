@article{canou_tezos_nodate,
	title = {Tezos: the {OCaml} {Crypto}-{Ledger}},
	abstract = {In this talk, we will present the story of the Tezos project. Tezos is a crypto-ledger, i.e. a distributed blockchain with a language to express smart contracts, with two speciﬁc characteristics: the ﬁrst one is its ability for self-amendment, that allows a majority of stake-holders to update the behavior of Tezos without risking a fork; the second one is a design and implementation (in OCaml) that took into account safety and security from the very beginning, and in particular the use of static typing and formal methods when possible. For example, Michelson, the smart contract language of Tezos, is the only such language with a formal semantics, a type system ensuring no runtime errors, and an implementation that uses OCaml GADTs to ensure its correctness.},

	title = {Tezos — a self-amending crypto-ledger {White} paper},
	abstract = {We present Tezos, a generic and self-amending crypto-ledger. Tezos can instantiate any blockchain based ledger. The operations of a regular blockchain are implemented as a purely functional module abstracted into a shell responsible for network operations. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cryptonote, etc. can all be represented within Tezos by implementing the proper interface to the network layer. Most importantly, Tezos supports meta upgrades: the protocols can evolve by amending their own code. To achieve this, Tezos begins with a seed protocol defining a procedure for stakeholders to approve amendments to the protocol, including amendments to the voting procedure itself. This is not unlike philosopher Peter Suber’s Nomic[3], a game built around a fully introspective set of rules.},

	title = {Tezos: the {OCaml} {Crypto}-{Ledger}},
	abstract = {In this talk, we will present the story of the Tezos project. Tezos is a crypto-ledger, i.e. a distributed blockchain with a language to express smart contracts, with two speciﬁc characteristics: the ﬁrst one is its ability for self-amendment, that allows a majority of stake-holders to update the behavior of Tezos without risking a fork; the second one is a design and implementation (in OCaml) that took into account safety and security from the very beginning, and in particular the use of static typing and formal methods when possible. For example, Michelson, the smart contract language of Tezos, is the only such language with a formal semantics, a type system ensuring no runtime errors, and an implementation that uses OCaml GADTs to ensure its correctness.},
